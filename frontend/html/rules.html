      <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
      <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
      <p>- Be the first player to get all three of your pawns from your start area to your home.</p>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>- Each player takes three pawns of one color.  </p>
    <h3>Game Play</h3>
    <p>On your turn:<br>
       -  Draw a card from the SORRY! deck and follow the instructions on the card.</p>
        <h3>Starting a Pawn</h3>
        <p>- Any forward-moving card can move a pawn out of its start area.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving Around the Board</h3>
        <p>- Pawns move clockwise around the board, unless a card instructs them otherwise.
           <br> - Any time you land by exact count on the triangle at the beginning of a slide that shows your color, slide ahead to the end and bump any pawns in your way − including your own! − back to their own start areas.
            If you land on a slide that does not show your color, don't slide, just stay put on the triangle.

           <br>- Only you may enter your own color safety zone. When moving along the outside track, you may not move your pawn forward past your own safety zone entry.
            <br>- You must bring all three of your pawns into home by exact count. Once home, do not move that pawn again for the rest of the game.
            
        </p>
        <h3>Jumping and Bumping</h3>
        <p>- You may jump over your own or another player's pawn if it is in your way, counting it as one space.<br>
            - But, if you land on a space that's already occupied by an opponent's pawn, bump that pawn back to its own color start area and take the space!
             </p>
        <h3>Occupied Spaces</h3>
        <p>- Only one of your pawns may occupy a space at a time, except for the start area or home.<br>

           -  If your only possible move would require you to land on a space already occupied by one of your other pawns, you forfeit your turn.
            
           <br>-  If at any time you cannot move, you forfeit your turn. But if you can move, you must move, even if it is not to your advantage!
            </p>
